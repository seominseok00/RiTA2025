It is now necessary to declare any competing interests or to specifically
state that the authors have no competing interests. Please place the
statement with a bold run-in heading in small font size beneath the
(optional) acknowledgments\footnote{If EquinOCS, our proceedings submission
system, is used, then the disclaimer can be provided directly in the system.},
for example: The authors have no competing interests to declare that are
relevant to the content of this article. Or: Author A has received research
grants from Company W. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from
Company X and owns stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.
