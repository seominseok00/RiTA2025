Comments to author (Associate Editor)
=====================================

This paper is professionally prepared and proposes
extending Lagrangian-based constrained RL. My detailed
comments are as follows:
1. Clarify and align the SCMDP problem statement with the
implemented objective and the evaluation metric. It seems
there is inconsistency in SCMDP formulation.
2. The authors should also pay attention to the notations,
to make sure they are consistent throughout the entire
paper.
3. The authors may also consider provide a brief
theoretical discussion on existence of saddle points with
state-dependent multipliers and function approximation.
